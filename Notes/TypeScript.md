### What is TypeScript ?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.

For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like `string` and `number`, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.
